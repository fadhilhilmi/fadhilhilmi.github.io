DATA CLEANSING

This project is to show a simple syntax on cleansing data in R.

In simple way, it is basically to capture how to identify the different data type in the table itself.

We can actually convertand/or remove a data type into another type. Only then we can use the function accordingly.

For instance, when we want to get the mean of the price, we will not be able to do that if the string "dollar" still on the set.
Thus it is important to remove the string and ensure the data type is in integer form .
